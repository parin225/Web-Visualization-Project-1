This is an analysis of over 500 different cities across the world of varying distances        from the equator on March 26, 2019. The purpose of this project was to showcase the relationship between the following relationships: Temperature vs. Latitude, Humidity vs. Latitude, Cloudiness vs. Latitude and Wind Speed vs Latitude.

A weather check was performed on each of the cities using a series of successful API  calls.

After gathering all the data from OpenWeatherMap, we used Matplotlib to create scatter plots showcasing the relationship of the factors mentioned above. This website provides the visualizations created as part of the analysis and any conclusions observed from our analysis.
